Take inspo from Obey the System for overall block structure. As far as the blocks go, 

Maybe something a bit like Rokku's Rotating blocks, but stating instead - 
a large one promoting the blog page, a large one promoting the livestream page, one promoting the discord server (pitching it in a tone akin to staying connecting neurally or via a cyberdeck after the stream). Maybe a banner for the main stream game(s), if I could ever keep up with that.... lmao. Maybe they will make me finish games, the thought of having to update an image every time i drop a game and pick up another. 

Webring for friends? Open to mutuals? 

Separate page for socials, or bake them into the home page?

Blog page. Then separate HTML pages for types of review? Or combine everything? Should I use a tag system?
All new articles will have their own new HTML pages.

The save point will have its own html page, but all the blog posts will be contained on that one page, like a microblog. Not too different than getcubed or velvetblue's diary pages.

I am going to need a VOD archive page if I am continuing the unlisted VOD's on youtube path. Peertube is gonna be too expensive to host remotely and I don't really wanna self host, because ya know, Florida weather.

Button wall at the bottom of the home page, but a bit more utility out of them this go around. 

Take your time.


The index page is finished.
