<!-- 
- Consider flexbox for mapping. Confine things to center of 
screen and then center all flex boxes, rather than this 
barbaric CSS centering with margins and padding.

- Maybe add in some flair in the edges or corner of the screen. 
Some simple, duplicated diag. lines in the corner for a cyber look? 
Or maybe just keep it simple. I could also encase the connect warning 
in a big CLI looking window.

- Aside from the above considerations, I think this landing page is done for now.
